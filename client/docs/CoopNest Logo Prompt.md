# Logo Generation Prompt for CoopNest

## Core Design Elements

"Create a modern, material design logo for 'CoopNest', a cooperative financial management system. The logo should be:

- Minimal and sophisticated with a matte finish
- Combine a stylized nest icon with subtle cooperative/financial symbolism
- Use a primary deep navy (#1A237E) and secondary teal (#00796B) color scheme
- Include the text 'CoopNest' in a clean, modern sans-serif font (preferably Poppins)
- Convey security, community, and financial growth

The nest element should subtly incorporate cooperative principles (shared resources, community support) while maintaining professional financial services aesthetic. The design should work in both light and dark modes, and remain legible at different scales.

The logo should visually represent a system where members collaboratively build financial security - like birds building a nest together - with an elegant, trustworthy appearance appropriate for a financial services application.

Ensure the design follows material design principles with subtle shadows, clean lines, and a slight depth effect that suggests reliability without being overly three-dimensional. The overall impression should be of a modern fintech solution that prioritizes community."
