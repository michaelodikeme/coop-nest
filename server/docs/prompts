Alright at this point let's work on enhancing the biodata module for managing the members of the cooperative, so understand this, the biodata at first will be filled with datas of exisiting members of the cooperative, using their phone numbers, and on successful verification, the members can can then create an account with a username and password to login into the system, then for new persons who want to join the cooperative, they can apply to join the cooperative throguh the user model's registration endpoint which is already set up, and admins will have to approve the biodata registration request, upon approval, the new user gets an approval email notification of thier request to join the cooperative and then prompted to verify thier biodata to enable them create a username and password to login(which i think we've already setup on the user module), and then initially on the biodata module, admins can also add/create a new biodata entry which will have to go through the same approval process and upon approval, the new user which the biodata is being crreated for will get a notification for biodata verification to let them create a username and password to login into the system, same way for the user endpoint registration, so now knowing that we're to migrate (upload an excel file) an existing records of members of the cooperative into the database through the biodata module, we need to create a comprehensive upload service that will upload the exisitng records using the following fields `erpId	ippisId	name	dateOfEmployment	department	staffNo	residentialAddress	emailAddress	phoneNumber	nextOfKin	relationshipOfNextOfKin	nextOfKinPhoneNumber	nextOfKinEmailAddress
` but this upload will go through only a level 2 approval stage for the treasurer, and mark all the uploaded biodata entry as approved, and on the verification side a user cannot start a verification process if the biodata is not approved, please note all of this. 

And so therefore here is the logic i want us to work with, in line with the enhanced prisma schema we worked on, so that the biodata module will be efficient and effective just like the savings module, we did great on the saavings module so let's apply same insights on this biodata module, if you look deep into this module, you'll notice that most of the features i am talking about are already implemented, but i want you to dig in deep and see how we modelled it, and give it the best work flow of how i explain it to a better standard, check if it allighs properperly with our intended roles and permission levels we've stated so that the biodata module stands out, since it's one of the core fundamentals of the system, with proper crud operations.
